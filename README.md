# Skin-cancer-detection-RESNET50-EFFICIENTNETB0-
This project focuses on developing an automated system to classify skin lesions using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0. The system is trained on the HAM10000 dataset and is capable of identifying 3 types of skin lesions:  AKIEC (Actinic Keratoses)  BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma)  NV (Melanocytic Nevi)
