 # üß† Skin Cancer Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model (ResNet50 & EfficientNetB0)

This project presents an AI-powered system for **automated skin cancer detection** using a **hybrid deep learning model** that combines **ResNet50** and **EfficientNetB0** architectures. The model is trained and evaluated on the **HAM10000** dataset to classify common types of skin lesions.
The system is trained on the HAM10000 dataset and is capable of identifying 3 types of skin lesions: 

AKIEC (Actinic Keratoses)  
BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma)  
NV (Melanocytic Nevi) 

## üìÑ Abstract

Skin cancer is one of the most common and potentially life-threatening cancers worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical. This project proposes a **hybrid deep learning model** combining **ResNet50** and **EfficientNetB0**, trained on the HAM10000 dataset to classify skin lesions. Techniques like **data augmentation**, **transfer learning**, and **feature fusion** significantly enhance classification accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Name:** HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images)
- **Source:** ISIC Archive
- **Classes Used:**
  - Actinic Keratoses (AKIEC)
  - Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
  - Melanocytic Nevi (NV)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Resized to `224x224` pixels
  - Normalized pixel values to [0, 1]
  - Label extraction via `dx` column
  - Stratified split into training, validation, and test sets
